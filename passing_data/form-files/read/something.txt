I was too scared too fail so I didn't even try,
because I didn't even try I failed every single day and I didn't even see it.
I'd rather fail while trying, beacuse one day I might actually win. 
You have to take the burden of your existence, nothing in this life comes free
Especially not the good things, if you have some good things cherish them and work for them.
